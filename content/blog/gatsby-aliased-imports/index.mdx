Have you ever written code like this?

```javascript
import { CustomButton } from '../../../components/buttons/custom-button';
import { useCustomHook } from '../../../hooks/use-custom-hook';
```

As your project's codebase expands, it's easy to end up with multiple embedded layers of folders, and that can turn your file imports into a tangled web of dots and slashes.

This tutorial will walk you through converting your Gatsby project's relative imports into absolute, aliased imports:

```javascript
import { CustomButton } from '@/components';
import { useCustomHook } from '@/hooks';
```

<CodeNote href="https://github.com/jonrutter/blog-examples/tree/main/gatsby-aliased-imports" />

## Configuring absolute imports

The first step to simplifying our file imports will be configuring our Gatsby project to support importing files relative to the project root, like:

```javascript
import { TestComponent } from 'src/components/test-component';
```

There's a couple things we'll need to do to achieve this:

1. Configure webpack to understand absolute imports.
2. Configure other technologies that need to know about how to correctly import files (e.g., TypeScript or Jest).

### Configuring webpack to support root imports

Because Gatsby uses [webpack](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/glossary/webpack/) under the hood to bundle our code, we'll need to configure webpack to understand absolute imports. Webpack configuration can get fairly complex, but fortunately there's a Gatsby plugin that'll take care of the details for us: [gatsby-plugin-root-import](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-root-import/). Let's install it:

```bash
npm install gatsby-plugin-root-import
```

Next, you'll need to add the plugin to your `gatsby-config`:

<CodeTabs one="JavaScript" two="TypeScript">
  <CodePanel>

```javascript filename=gatsby-config.js lines=5
const config = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    // ... other plugins
    `gatsby-plugin-root-import`,
  ],
};
export default config;
```

  </CodePanel>
  <CodePanel>

```typescript filename=gatsby-config.ts lines=7
import type { GatsbyConfig } from 'gatsby';

const config: GatsbyConfig = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    // ... other plugins
    `gatsby-plugin-root-import`,
  ],
};
export default config;
```

  </CodePanel>
</CodeTabs>

This plugin supports root imports out of the box, without any need for additional configuration. So the following should work automatically:

```javascript
import { CustomButton } from 'src/components/buttons/custom-button';
```

Already that's an improvement over our old relative imports. It's easier to understand exactly where the file is, and the import statement won't break if the file we're importing to is moved.

_**Note**: if you'd like to try configuring webpack yourself, you can do that through gatsby-node's `onCreateWebpackConfig` api. For more information, check out this [how-to guide on configuring webpack](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/custom-configuration/add-custom-webpack-config/) from the Gatsby docs._

</Note>

### Adding TypeScript support for root imports

If your project uses TypeScript, you'll need to add another step to make the TypeScript compiler understand absolute imports.

In your `tsconfig.json` file, add the following:

```json filename=tsconfig.json lines=4
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "baseUrl": "."
  }
}
```

This lets TypeScript know that whatever you set as the `baseUrl` (in this case, the project root) should be treated as the base directory when resolving non-relative file imports. So when TypeScript encounters `src/components`, it'll understand that this means `./src/components`.

## Upgrading to import aliases

Your project should now support absolute file paths in import statements. Great! But there are a few more tweaks we can do to make file imports even simpler.

First, we can use import aliases:

```javascript
// without import aliases:
import { CustomButton } from 'src/components/buttons/custom-button';

// with import aliases:
import { CustomButton } from '@/components/buttons/custom-button';
```

Although that doesn't look like a big difference now, it's a starting point to make our imports much shorter later.

### Configuring webpack to support aliases

To get this working, we'll again need to update our webpack config. Fortunately, `gatsby-plugin-root-import` can do the heavy lifting for us again. Update your `gatsby-config` like so:

<CodeTabs one="JavaScript" two="TypeScript">
  <CodePanel>

```javascript filename=gatsby-config.js lines=1,6,7,8,9,10,11
import path from 'path';
const config = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    // ...
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-root-import',
      options: {
        '@': path.join(__dirname, 'src'),
      },
    },
  ],
};
export default config;
```

  </CodePanel>
  <CodePanel>

```typescript filename=gatsby-config.ts lines=2,8,9,10,11,12,13
import type { GatsbyConfig } from 'gatsby';
import path from 'path';

const config: GatsbyConfig = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    // ...
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-root-import',
      options: {
        '@': path.join(__dirname, 'src'),
      },
    },
  ],
};
export default config;
```

  </CodePanel>
</CodeTabs>

So what's happening here? Every entry added to `options` will be treated by the plugin as a webpack import alias. So in other words, we've just told webpack to convert `@` to `src`.

You can add as many import aliases as you like. For example, you could add a separate alias for `@components` or `@hooks`.

This is especially useful if you're using deeply nested folders. For example, the Redux docs recommend [organizing your logic into "feature folders"](https://redux.js.org/faq/code-structure#what-should-my-file-structure-look-like-how-should-i-group-my-action-creators-and-reducers-in-my-project-where-should-my-selectors-go), like `./src/features/todos`. If you choose to structure your program like that, you may find it convenient to alias `./src/features/todos` as simply `@todos`.

### Configuring TypeScript to support aliases

Just like before, we'll need to update TypeScript to mirror our new config. In your `tsconfig.json` file, add:

```json filename=tsconfig.json lines=4,5,6
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["src/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

Any entries added to `paths` will be re-mapped by TypeScript. Note that all mappings are relative to whatever was specified in the `baseUrl`. If you're interested, you can read more about [tsconfig paths](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#paths) in the TypeScript docs.

_**Note**: If you're using VS Code, you may need to restart it before the new import aliases are recognized._

</Note>

### Configuring Jest

If you're using Jest to test your Gatsby project, you'll need to update your Jest config to support import aliases. If you haven't already, make sure you've correctly configured Jest to work with Gatsby. If you need more information on that, the Gatsby docs have a great article on [adding unit tests to Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/testing/unit-testing/).

You can configure Jest to understand path aliases by adding them to `moduleNameMapper` in your `jest.config.js`. If your project uses TypeScript, you can easily import the path aliases from `tsconfig.json` using a utility function from [ts-jest](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest):

```javascript filename=jest.config.js
const { compilerOptions } = require('./tsconfig.json');
const { pathsToModuleNameMapper } = require('ts-jest');

const paths = pathsToModuleNameMapper(compilerOptions.paths, {
  prefix: '<rootDir>/',
});

module.exports = {
  // ...

  moduleNameMapper: {
    // ... other module names
    ...paths,
  },

  // ...
};
```

By dynamically importing your import aliases through `pathsToModuleNameMapper`, Jest will always be in sync with TypeScript, and any time you update your import aliases in `tsconfig.json`, the changes will be automatically recognized by Jest. Otherwise, you'd need to manually specify each of the path aliases in `jest.config.js`:

```javascript filename=jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  // ...

  moduleNameMapper: {
    // ... other module names
    '^@/(.*)': '<rootDir>/src/$1', // configuring the @ alias
  },

  // ...
};
```

<Note color="blue">

_See the Jest docs for [more information about mapping module names](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#modulenamemapper-objectstring-string--arraystring)._

</Note>

## Re-export components

A final, optional step that I sometimes like to do in my projects is to re-export components from the base `./components` directory.

For example, consider a project structured like this:

```
src
└── components
    ├── test-component-one.tsx
    ├── test-component-two.tsx
    └── buttons
        └── custom-button.tsx
```

In the `buttons` folder, we can add an `index.js` or `index.ts` file, and re-export all the other files in `buttons`:

```javascript filename=src/components/buttons/index.js
export * from './custom-button';
```

Then we can import any of the button components as:

```javascript
import { CustomButton } from '@/components/buttons';
```

But we can take it one step further, and again re-export components from the root of `./components`. In `components/index.js`:

```javascript filename=src/components/index.js
export * from './test-component-one';
export * from './test-component-two';
export * from './buttons';
```

Now, any of our components can be imported directly from `./components` as:

```javascript
import { CustomButton } from '@/components';
```

This can also give you a higher degree of control over the encapsulation of different parts of your codebase. For example, say you have a todo list application, with a folder structure like this:

```
src
└── features
    ├── todos
        ├── index.ts
        ├── todos-slice.ts
        ├── utils.ts
        ├── TodoList.ts
        └── Todo.tsx
    ├── user-settings
    └── authentication
```

Imagine that `utils.ts` is part of the internal implementation of `todos`. As such, it isn't meant to be used by outside code, and doing so could cause some pretty big problems. If some other code outside of `todos` depended on `utils`, any refactor of the implementation of `todos` could unexpectedly cause the rest of your app to break! Obviously that wouldn't be ideal.

So to prevent problems like this, you might want to avoid exposing the functions in `utils` to the rest of your application. Now, you could just put in a comment telling your future self (and other developers working on the project) not to import it, and hope that works, but that's not a very reliable approach.

Instead, you could write your feature's `index.ts` file like this:

```typescript filename=src/features/todos/index.ts
export * from 'todos-slice';
export * from 'TodoList';
export * from 'Todo';
```

Notice that `utils.ts` isn't included in `index.ts`. As long as you remember to always import a feature's code from the feature's root `index.ts` file, you can create a standard interface to control which parts of `todos` are exposed to the rest of your project, and which parts are hidden as implementation details.

## Summary

And that sums it up! That's how you can transform your relative imports into absolute, aliased imports in your Gatsby project.
