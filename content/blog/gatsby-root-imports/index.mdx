excerpt: Simplify your development experience by converting your relative imports in Gatsby to absolute imports.

Have you ever written code like this?

```javascript
import { CustomButton } from '../../../components/buttons/custom-button';
import { customHook } from '../../../hooks/custom-hook';
```

When you're working with any kind of non-trivial codebase, it's easy to end up with multiple embedded layers of folders, and that can turn your file imports into a tangled web of dots and slashes.

Even worse, if you ever decide to restructure your application in the future, you may need to go through your whole codebase and update all your imports. Sometimes your code editor will help with that, but it may not be perfect, and at a minimum it invites the potential for bugs and headaches.

This blog post will show you how you can update your Gatsby project to convert your old relative file imports into absolute imports, like this:

```javascript
import { CustomButton } from '@/components';
import { customHook } from '@/hooks';
```

## Configure absolute imports

There's a few steps we'll need to take for our Gatsby project to support absolute imports:

1. Configure webpack to understand absolute imports.
2. Configure other technologies that need to know about how to correctly import files (e.g., TypeScript or Jest).

### Configure Webpack

Configuring webpack can be complex, but fortunately there's a Gatsby plugin that'll take care of that for us!

First, let's install `gatsby-plugin-root-import`

```bash
npm install gatsby-plugin-root-import
```

Next, we'll need to add the plugin to our gatsby-config:

<CodeTabs one="JavaScript" two="TypeScript">
  <CodePanel>

```javascript
const config = {
  // ...
  plugins: [`gatsby-plugin-root-import`],
};
export default config;
```

  </CodePanel>
  <CodePanel>

```typescript
import type { GatsbyConfig } from 'gatsby';

const config: GatsbyConfig = {
  // ...
  plugins: [`gatsby-plugin-root-import`],
};
export default config;
```

  </CodePanel>
</CodeTabs>

This will allow us to directly import files from the `src` folder, like:

```javascript
import { CustomButton } from 'src/components/buttons/custom-button';
```

Already that's an improvement over the old relative imports!

_Note: if you'd like to try configuring webpack yourself, without the plugin, you can do that through gatsby-node's `onCreateWebpackConfig` api (in fact, that's what the plugin uses behind the scenes!). For more information, check out this [how-to guide on configuring webpack](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/custom-configuration/add-custom-webpack-config/) from the Gatsby docs._

### Add TypeScript support

If you work with TypeScript, you'll need to add another step so that the compiler can understand absolute imports.

In your tsconfig.json file, add the following:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "baseUrl": "."
  }
}
```

This tells TypeScript that whatever you set as the `baseUrl` (in this case, the project root) should be treated as the base directory when resolving non-relative file imports. So in our example, when TypeScript encounters `src/components`, it'll treat it as `./src/components` (relative to the project root).

## Add import aliases

Your project should now support absolute file paths in imports. Great! But there are a few more tweaks we can do to make the imports even simpler.

First, we can use import aliases.

As it stands now, your project should now support importing components like:

```javascript
import { SomeComponent } from 'src/components/some-component';
```

Let's add an import alias to turn that into:

```javascript
import { SomeComponent } from '@/components/some-component';
```

### Update webpack config to support aliases

Fortunately, `gatsby-plugin-root-import` can do the heavy lifting for us again! Update your gatsby-config like so:

<CodeTabs one="JavaScript" two="TypeScript">
  <CodePanel>

```javascript
import path from 'path';
const config = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    // ...
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-root-import',
      options: {
        '@': path.join(__dirname, 'src'),
      },
    },
  ],
};
export default config;
```

  </CodePanel>
  <CodePanel>

```typescript
import type { GatsbyConfig } from 'gatsby';
import path from 'path';

const config: GatsbyConfig = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    // ...
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-root-import',
      options: {
        '@': path.join(__dirname, 'src'),
      },
    },
  ],
};
export default config;
```

  </CodePanel>
</CodeTabs>

Each entry added to `options` will be treated by the plugin as a webpack import alias. So in other words, we've just told webpack to treat `@` in imports as equivalent to `src`!

You can add as many import aliases as you like. For example, you could add a separate alias for `@components`, `@hooks`, and so on.

This is especially useful if you're using deeply embedded folders. For example, Redux recommends [organizing your logic into "feature folders"](https://redux.js.org/faq/code-structure#what-should-my-file-structure-look-like-how-should-i-group-my-action-creators-and-reducers-in-my-project-where-should-my-selectors-go), like `./src/features/todos`. If you structure your program like that, you may want to alias `./src/features/todos` as `@todos`.

### Update TypeScript to support aliases

Now that we've added an import alias to our config, we'll need to update TypeScript to understand how to compile the new imports.

Update your tsconfig.json file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["src/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

Any entries added to "paths" will tell TypeScript to re-map those imports. Note that all mappings are relative to whatever you specified as the `baseUrl`.

### Support aliases in Jest

If you're using Jest for testing, you'll need to tell it how to resolve import aliases. You can do that in your jest.config file with `moduleNameMapper`:

```javascript
const config = {
  // ...
  moduleNameMapper: {
    '^@/(.*)': '<rootDir>/src/$1',
  },
};
export default config;
```

_See the [Jest docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#modulenamemapper-objectstring-string--arraystring) for more information._

## Re-export components

A final step that I like to do in some of my projects is to re-export components from the base `./components` directory.

For example, consider a project structured like this:

```
src
└── components
    ├── component-one.tsx
    ├── component-two.tsx
    └── buttons
        ├── button-one.tsx
        └── button-two.tsx
```

In the buttons folder, you can add an `index.js`/`index.ts` file, and re-export all the other files in `./buttons`:

```javascript
export * from './button-one';
export * from './button-two';
```

That way, you can import any of the button components as:

```javascript
import { ButtonOne } from '@/components/buttons';
```

But you can take it one step further, and again re-export components from the root of `./components`. In `components/index.js`:

```javascript
export * from './component-one';
export * from './component-two';

export * from './buttons';
```

Now, any of your components can be imported directly from `./components` as:

```javascript
import { ButtonOne } from '@/components';
```

This is a personal preference, and some may disagree with re-exporting everything from the root components folder, but I find it helpful for organizing my code.

## Summary

And there you have it! That's how you can transform relative imports into root imports in Gatsby!
